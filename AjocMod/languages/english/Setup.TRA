The katana is a single-edged, slightly curved sword that ends with a chisel point. The katana is perhaps one of the finest swords ever made, the steps to its creation a long and secret process, that is more art form than anything else.  This blade is an important facet of Kara-Tur culture.  To touch or wield a samurai's katana is to insult the samurai and to incite his wrath.  For a gaijin, or foreigner, to own such a blade is a rare occurrence. Either the gaijin is a greatly honored friend of an important minister, or  the gaijin has murdered a samurai.

@29   = ~Blade of the Night

This was the weapon used by the most famous assassin in Kara Tur, but no one knew her NAME1 apart from the emperor.  She was the greatest thief the world had ever seen.  She received this powerful weapon after completing a series of succesful missions for the emperor, who decided she was worthy of the blade.  It was made by the emperor's best weapon smiths, and then tempered in the bloods of  red, black, silver and blue dragons. The legend says this weapon would make anyone almost as good as a thief as the original owner, but because of the strong enchantments, the katana requires much from its wielder, and it is only usable by a thief. How it has ended in your hands, is anyone's guess.

   I hope you received this on time, because I write with terrible news. Corpae has acquired a small group of followers and has therefore regained considerable power. He is after you, seeking revenge. It is only a matter of time before he is powerful enough to teleport straight to your home shrine and capture you, so I suggest you leave at once to Athkatla, where Corpae will not be able to use any magic due to the strict laws enforced by the Cowled Wizards. Should you need to return to your shrine, I suggest acquiring protection of a sort.

If you should need to seek refuge, I am currently residing in a small Inn near the City Gates.

It is made entirely of steel, with rondels protecting and strengthening the grip.  Rondels are small disks of metal, often shaped into decorative designs.  The shaft is about 18 inches long.
