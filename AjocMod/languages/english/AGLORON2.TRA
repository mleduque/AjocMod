@7   = ~Fear not, you shall be rewarded, what do y-~
@8   = ~Sorry for the...lie...I thought I would scare you from escorting me if I said Adilthora was a shrine in the middle of this forest.~
@9   = ~I guess it doesn't matter that much, assuming I get a reward!~

@11  = ~Well, we got kind of worried. It's thanks to Ademoth we found you!~
@12  = ~We didn't REALLY care about you really, it was the reward, which I think you still owe me that attracted me here.~
@13  = ~I know, I know you want your reward. I could see it in your eyes. But...~
@14  = ~...I can't. Not until my shrine is uncursed. I am so weak, I have no one to worship me.  I am barely able to stand.~
@15  = ~Looks like I'm going to have to follow Corpae and his cronies through the portal!~

@24  = ~Oh and beware of the Oak Fist. They are ancient Clan of Battle Dwatves, and I am not sure why they aid Corpae.~
@25  = ~Well, thanks for the information. I will return as soon as possible.~
@26  = ~Please return soon! I feel myself getting weaker, and Corpae getting stronger!~
@27  = ~I feel strength returning...Corpae must be dead!~
